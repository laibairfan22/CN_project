# Computer Network Topology with VLAN, NAT, Subnetting, EIGRP, OSPF, RIP

**Overview**
The Computer Network Topology project aims to create a comprehensive and scalable computer network topology using various networking concepts such as VLANs, NAT, subnetting, EIGRP, OSPF, RIP, and more. This project provides a practical and hands-on approach to network design, allowing users to understand and implement key networking protocols and technologies.

# Features
**VLAN Implementation:**
Design and implement Virtual LANs (VLANs) to logically segment the network and enhance performance and security.

**Network Address Translation (NAT):**
Configure NAT to allow private network devices to access the internet using a single public IP address.

**Subnetting:**
Divide the network into subnets to optimize IP address utilization and manage network traffic efficiently.

# Dynamic Routing Protocols:

**EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):**
Implement EIGRP for efficient routing within the network.
**OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):**
Configure OSPF for dynamic routing and link-state advertisement.
**RIP (Routing Information Protocol):**
Use RIP for simple and straightforward routing.
**Security Measures:**
Implement security measures such as access control lists (ACLs) to control traffic flow and enhance network security.

# Technology Stack
**Network Simulation Tool:** Cisco Packet Tracer
**Routing Protocols:** EIGRP, OSPF, RIP
**VLAN Configuration:** Cisco 3 layered switches
**NAT Implementation:** Cisco routers
**Subnetting:** IPv4 addressing


# How to Run
To simulate the Computer Network Topology, follow these steps:

Select Network Simulation Tool: Choose a network simulation tool compatible with the project requirements (e.g., Cisco Packet Tracer).

Import Topology File: Load the provided topology file or manually configure devices, connections, and settings based on the project specifications.

Start Simulation: Run the simulation and observe the behavior of VLANs, NAT, subnetting, and routing protocols within the network.
